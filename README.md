# colony_counting_project

**Overview :**
This Python project automates the process of counting colonies in microbiological samples using image processing techniques. By leveraging OpenCV, the project identifies and counts colonies based on contour detection, making it a valuable tool for researchers and professionals in biotechnology and microbiology.

<u>**Features**</u>
Image Upload: Load images of colony plates for analysis.
Colony Detection: Use OpenCV contour detection to identify and count colonies.
Visual Results: Highlight detected colonies on the processed image.
Adjustable Parameters: Modify sensitivity and thresholds for more accurate results.
Export Results: Save colony counts and processed images for documentation.


**Technology Stack -**

Programming Language: Python 
Libraries:\
OpenCV (Image processing)\
NumPy (Numerical operations)\
Matplotlib (Visualization)\

**Installation-**

Clone the repository:\
git clone https://github.com/your-username/colony-counting-python.git \
cd colony-counting-python

Install required dependencies:\
pip install -r requirements.txt 

Run the project:\
python colony_counter.py 

**Usage-** 
Place the image(s) of colony plates in the specified folder (e.g., input_images).\
Run the script and follow the prompts to upload an image.\
The script will process the image, detect colonies, and display the results.\
The output will include:\
Total colony count.\
Processed image with detected colonies highlighted.\
Optional export of results to a file.


Processed Output:\
Colonies highlighted with contours.\
Display of the total colony count.
